> Source for https://zeppelinos.org

The OpenZeppelin SDK project used to be named ZeppelinOS.
This repository had the source code for the old website of that project.

After the rename, the new website is https://openzeppelin.com/sdk.

This repository now hosts only a netlify redirect from the old website to the new one.
